The language includes built-in support for arrays, strings, mathematical operations, file I/O, and system calls.

**Project Overview** : VG Language is an educational programming language designed to teach new programmers how to code by creating both console applications and graphical user interfaces  . The name comes from "Visual" and "Graphics", reflecting its focus on accessibility and GUI development.

Key Features: The language includes the following

- **Variables** , constants, and arrays
- **Control flow** (if statements, loops)
- **Functions and object-oriented programming**
- **Error handling with try-catch blocks**
- **Built-in GUI development capabilities**
- **Package management system**

##  Getting Started

To start using VG, run the following commands inside the windows terminal:

```bash
 vg.exe <file.vg> --help

   VG Language Interpreter
Usage:
  vg <file>                  Run a VG program
  vg --help                  Show this help message
  vg --version               Show the version number
  vg --docgen <in> <out>     Generate documentation

Documentation Generation:
  vg --docgen <input-path> <output-directory>
    <input-path> can be a single file or a directory
    <output-directory> is where the documentation will be generated

Examples:
  vg program.vg              Run program.vg
  vg --docgen program.vg ./docs
  vg --docgen libraries/Guilibrary.vglib ./docs
  vg --docgen . ./docs       Generate docs for entire project
```
